EECS498-XR Project 2 finished by Jin Pan and Enming Xu

In Milestone, we learn how to design UI in Unity, add some interesting landmarks, seeds and juicy music to it.

In the later Alpha part, we dig deeper around Exploration and Interaction modes. In Exploration mode, players discover landmarks and unlock new seeds. Interaction mode allows close-up engagement with trees and squirrels. The game includes various GameObjects and a well-designed UI, complete with a currency system. Technical aspects like coordinate conversions and performance considerations are addressed, employing Unity's specific functionalities such as raycasting and AbstractMap..

In the final gold part, our custom feature is that: Engage in an exhilarating battle with Usokki, a formidable boss known for its elusive dodging abilities in the interactive combat scene. Upon conquering this challenging foe, you'll unlock the opportunity to recruit Usokki as a loyal follower. Once acquired, Usokki will accompany the player on their exploratory journey, traversing the expansive map alongside you..
