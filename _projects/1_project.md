EECS498-XR Project 1 finished by Jin Pan and Enming Xu

In Milestone, we realized a general simulation for 1695 BBB with all those ceilings, walls, pillars, dividers and all the other necessary settings for a computer lab.

In the later Alpha part, we realized more interactive features thanks to the affordability offered by the Unreal Blueprints. We added several incredible features like the passerby lost in the infinite loop, the writable whiteboard, intractable NPC from Apex Legend, emergency fire alarm, online wall fliers and day-night progression..

In the final gold part, our custom feature is that Users can teleport to a new area playing with the Jenga similar to that one in the ppc. And if user messed up, he/she could easily use the red button to reset the whole Jenga and teleport back to the lab as well.

**Technology utilized:** *Unreal Engine 5*, *Blueprints*, *Oculus*, *Blender*, *JIRA*, etc..

**Specific features:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xKCVQRhd7Sfb0sLZjfH5EX5QESD3y1AKN7vodx6UHs/edit#gid=0
